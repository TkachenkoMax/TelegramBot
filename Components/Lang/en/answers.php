My name is Katarina, I'm your clever assistant in Telegram.
If you want to see a list of available commands and capabilities, write <i>/help</i>.

But first, tell me a bit about yourself:

1) <i>/setDateOfBirth &ltdate of birth&gt</i> -  specify your date of birth so I never forgot to congratulate you

2) <i>/setCity &ltlocality&gt</i> -  indicate your place of residence, which will help me in some queries

3) <i>/setAlias &ltalias&gt</i> - specify your nickname, that's how I'll contact you instead of :username

4) <i>/setLanguage</i> - specify the language on which I will write to you. At the moment only Russian and English are available

<b>You will succeed:)</b>",
